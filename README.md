# Software-Engineering-LCA
Implement LCA (presumably binary tree but its up to you) in two languages. The quality of the code is not that important. That it is in a repository is important. 

Add test code using a test framework of your choice that exercises the implementations. This requires you to familiarise yourself with two test frameworks, one for each language, and implement some test code that tests the implementations capacity to return the correct nodes when passed a graph and two child node identities. Use your common sense regarding how many test cases you write - ie. some basic testing, no need for all edge cases - maybe 2/3 tests? Deciding on what to test is part of the assignment. 

Read documentation and supporting materials associated with the test frameworks of your choice. Look at what engineers explaining the test framework in videos and blogs test. Get a feel for it. Use (and trust) your judgement. Remember that testing is a practical skill -and the judgement of the engineer is key. The hard part really is to get the test code up and running.
